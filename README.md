# React-To-Do-List

Introduction
This is a project that I have built and understood, based on an online tutorial.
It is a To-Do List application in which you can provide To-Do's as an input which can then be checked
as completed or deleted from your To-Do list. The list is saved locally so your objectives are saved for when 
yuo revisit the application.

The Project was Created with
- React
- CSS
- Git
